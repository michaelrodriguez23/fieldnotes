                This space will serve as documentation with the  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theurbanwild.us/about">The Urban Wild</a>.
                on developing virtual interactions.
                The focous  is around creating virtual spaces as a means of an exploration of what is possible 
                with agrictulral technology.<br>



<h3>Concepts for our virtual scenes.</h3><dl>
                    <dt> <strong> A Yielding Hydroponic System </strong> </dt>
                    <dd> A scenario where the user can sow seeds into a selected hydropnic system.
The interactions of the user will yield crop that can be visualized into a harvest measuring out how much food can be grown with the system. 
The gesture of sowing the seeds can trigger the animation of the crops growing. The as the crops grow, we can create a counter within the scene that keeps track of weight.
Lastly the experience will display a bowl of your harvest.

                    <dd> This concept the end user will have the oppurtunity to take a tour of a farm that implements agrictultural technology. 
A 3D rendering of the farm is needed ‚Äì using 360 degree spherical rendering using a 3D video camera. 
Later in post processing the rendering will be used to create a virtual bridge to the onsite farm. 

This will be rendered into a guided tour.<br>

                      I want to rework this idea from avoiding dystopia, and pehaps painting a utopia will be better serving as a means of hope. 
                      As a solarpunk this is a main feauture of the school of thought. Which is to act upon the future we hope to see, now! Delivered 
                      in a fashion of hope rather than doom.

Getting started I had to draw out what the roadmap of what it would like to execute the concepts mentioned previously.


For the first concept with AR scene of a hydroponic system yielding crops, I needed some sort of model to place in the scene. 

While searching for 3D objects to be used; many of the models were either inadequate, or not free.

Pondering I concluded that picking up the skills of learning Blender would utimitetly be beneficial; 
There are countless uses for the program - from 3D modeling - animation 
- AR - 3D Printing - animation ... and the list goes on. 

Blender is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre" target="_blank">free libre</a> open source software. 

I found that using open source as a medium to convey these ideas was appropriate  because 

I find free libre software and urban gardening to have a lot in common as a means of building 
for community, and as a technological discipline that can harbor skills that reclaim power back to the individual. 

I think of gardening as a radical act for 
fighting for the rights of people to have soveignetiy of their food.

In the same way open software is standing for the soveignerty of knowledge within technology. 

I have to admit I was always discouraged by the intimidating interface, but lets dive in head first.  

I really enjoyed this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlErCEe9A8o">tutorial</a>[Beginner Friendly], after spending some time I felt more comfortable,
and knowledgable of some of the basic tooling in blend.

                where they taught a summer <a href="http://sfpc.io/cocoon/programs/#augmented-reality">workshop</a> exploring augmented reality as an artistic, and technological displine.
